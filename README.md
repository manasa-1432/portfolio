#  PERSONAL-PORTFOLIO
Internship Project by Kare Manasa| frontend developement at codetech IT solutions task 3

**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
**NAME**: KARE MANASA  
**INTERN ID**: CT04DH1654  
**DOMAIN**: FRONT END DEVELOPMENT  
**DURATION**: 4 WEEKS  
**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH  

This project is a personal **Portfolio Website** created using **HTML and CSS**, showcasing my identity as a front-end developer. The project was developed as part of the CodTech internship and demonstrates my ability to build and structure a complete webpage using core front-end skills.

The landing section of the website greets the user with a warm welcome message and a navigation bar that links to different sections: About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. This navigation is implemented using anchor links that scroll smoothly to the respective sections on the page.

In the "About" section, I introduced myself with a professional image and a short biography. It includes details about my background, education at **Adikavi Nannaya University**, and how I self-learned web development through platforms like YouTube.

The "Skills" section highlights the technologies I am currently familiar with — including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic Python — presented in a simple list for clarity.

The "Projects" section contains a table listing my mini projects like a portfolio and a resume page. This section demonstrates that I can practically apply HTML and CSS knowledge to create usable, presentable components.

The final section is a contact form where users can enter their name, email, gender, and a brief message (bio). Although it doesn’t include a backend to store submissions, it displays form-building proficiency and input element usage including text inputs, radio buttons, and textarea.

This portfolio website project helped reinforce key web development concepts:
- Semantic HTML layout
- Internal linking with anchor tags
- Use of CSS for styling and responsiveness
- Form building and input validation
- Image integration and table creation

Overall, the portfolio reflects my journey and progress in front-end development and stands as a dynamic presentation of my learning. It can be further enhanced with animations, dark mode, downloadable resume, or backend form submission.
